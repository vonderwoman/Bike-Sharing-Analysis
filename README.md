# Project Title: Bike Sharing Analysis
Are you interested in bike sharing systems and their role in traffic, environmental, and health issues? Then you've come to the right place!

# Installation & Running
Here are the steps to install Anaconda on Windows:

    Go to the Anaconda website and download the latest version of Anaconda for Windows.

    Once the download is complete, double-click the .exe file to begin the installation process.

    In the Anaconda installer window, click "Next" to proceed.

    Read the license agreement and click "I Agree" to accept it.

    Choose the installation location or leave the default location and click "Next".

    Choose whether or not to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable and click "Install".

    Wait for the installation process to complete.

    Click "Next" and then "Finish" to complete the installation.

    Open the Anaconda Navigator from the Start menu and explore the available tools and environments.

    To create a new environment, click on "Environments" in the left pane of the Anaconda Navigator and then click on the "Create" button.

    Give the environment a name and choose the Python version you want to use, then click "Create".

    To install packages, select the environment you just created and click on the "Open with Jupyter Notebook" button. Then, open a new notebook and run !pip install <package> to install the package.

Congratulations! You have now installed Anaconda on Windows and created a new environment. You can start using Anaconda to manage your Python packages and environments.

üîç # Background
Bike sharing systems have become increasingly popular around the world. They provide an automatic rental process that allows users to easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another. The characteristics of the data generated by these systems make them attractive for research. Unlike other transport services such as buses or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing systems into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city.

# Objectives 
The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns or trends that could help a business optimize its operations, marketing strategies, or other aspects of its performance. The analysis also introduces hypothesis testing and time series analysis, which are common statistical techniques used in business research. The application of these techniques could help a business make data-driven decisions and improve its overall performance

# Data Set
UCI Machine Learning Repository

# Methods

Exploratory data analysis
Bivariate analysis
Hypothesis Testing
Time Series
Arima Model

# Associated Tasks
This dataset is useful for two main tasks: regression and event/anomaly detection. In the regression task, the goal is to predict the hourly or daily bike rental count based on the environmental and seasonal settings. Meanwhile, in the event and anomaly detection task, the count of rented bikes can be correlated to certain events in the town which can be easily traced via search engines. For instance, a search for "2012-10-30 Washington D.C." in Google may return related results to Hurricane Sandy. By identifying such events, the dataset can also be used to validate anomaly or event detection algorithms.
